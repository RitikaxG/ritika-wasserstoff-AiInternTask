    "summary": "The dispute arose regarding the payment of bonus in \u00b7 The workmen claimed that the sole object of bonus which had been grantecf to them upto that year was to meet puja expenses and that the payment of this bonus had become customary and a term of employment. Held, that the workmen were not entitled to puja bonus as an implied term of employment for an implied agreement could not be inferred when the appellant had made it clear that the payments from  to  were ex gratia but they were entitled to puja bonus on the basis that it was a customary and traditional payment. In determining whether the payment was customary and traditional the following circumstances have to be established (i) that the payment has been made over an unbroken series of years , (ii) that it has been for a sufficiently long period, the period has to be longer than in the case of an implied term of employment (iii) that it has been paid even in years of loss and did not depend on the earning of profits and (iv) that the payment has been made at a uniform rate throughout. The decision of the Appellate Tribunal has also mixed the two aspects of puja bonus, namely, whether it is based on an implied term of employment or on custom but it came to the conclusion that there was sufficient evidence to establish custom and therefore ordered payment of one month's basic wages as puja bonus. At that time it was said on behalf of the company before the industrial tribunal that some bonus was being paid and that there was no intention to discontinue it and conse- quently .the tribunal did not adjudicate upon the matter, which shows that the company recognised the traditional and customary nature of the payment and it assured the tribunal that there was no intention then to discontinue the payment.",
