    "summary": "The State of Punjab, [] S.C.R. , that the approver's evidence had to satisfy a double test i.e., he must be a reliable witness and his evidence must receive sufficient corroboration and in that the corroborating evidence was not sufficient to connect the appellant with the crime. Indeed, the Sessions Judge went to the length of telling the jury that although an approver's evidence is strictly admissible and a conviction is not illegal merely because it is based on an approver's evidence, it was a settled rule of practice not to convict a person on such evidence except under very rare and excep- tional circumstances and usually substantial cor- roboratLm was required. Apart from the question of corrobora- tion of the approver's evidence nothing was suggested to us or to the High Court in what respect the approver's evidence was unreliable after testing his evidence in the same way as one would test the evid- ence of any witness for the prosecution in a criminal case. It would be in high degree dangerous to attempt to formulate the kind of evidence which would be regarded as corroboration, except to say that corroborative evidence is evidence which shows or tends to show that the story of the accomplice that the accused committed the crime is true, not merely that the crime has been committed, but that it was commit- ted by the accused. \" In the present case the jury had been clearly directed by the Sessions Judge that corroborative evidence must be evidence which implicates the accused, i.e., which confirms in some material particulars not only the evidence that the crime had been committed but also that the appellant had committed it.",
