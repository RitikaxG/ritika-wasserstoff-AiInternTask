        "summary": "The entry reads tfius- \"Principles on which compensation for property acquired or requisitioned for purposes of the Union or of a State or for any other public purpose is to be determined, and the form and manner in which such compensation is to be given.\" This head of legislation seems to have been expressly mentioned in the Concurrent List not only in view of the accepted principle of law that in cases of compul- sory acquisition of property compensation has to be made but also in view of the clear and mandatory provisions of article () which require that a law authorising the taking or acquisition of propeny will be void if it does not provide for payment of compen- sation for the property acquired or does not either fix the amount of compensation or specify the principles on which and the manner in which the compensation is to be determined and given. We find that under article  Parliament has exclusive power to make laws with respect, inter ulia, to matters specified in entry  in List I, namely, \"acquisition or requisitioning of property for the pur- poses of the Union, that the State Legislatures have exclusive power to make laws with respect, inter alia, to matters specified in entry  in List II, namely, the \"acquisition or requisitioning of property except for the purposes of the Union subject to the provision of entry  of List III\" and that both Parliament and the State Legislatures may make laws with respect to matters set forth in entry  in List III, namely, the principles for determining the compensation and the form and manner of giving such compensation. This legislative power of Parliament or of the State Legis- latures is, by article , made \"subject to the provi- sions of this Constitution.\" One of the provilions 0f the Constitution is article  () under which no pro- perty can be \"taken possession of or acquired for public purposes under any law authorising the taking of such possession or such acquisition unless the law provides for compensation for the property and either fixes the amount of compensation or specifies the principles on which, and the mam1er in which, the compensation is to be determined and given.\" The scheme of our Constitution obviously is to provide the three things separately, namely, the power of making a law for acquisition of property in article  read with entry  in List I and entry  in List II, the obligation of such law to provide for compensation in article  () and the power of making a law laying down the \u00b7 principles for determining such compen- sation in article  read with entry  in List III. If the require- ment of a public purpose were not a provision of article  (), then it will obviously lead us to the un- tenable conclusion that Parliament will be free under its residuary powers under article  and entry  of List I of the Seventh Schedule to make a law for ac- quiring private property without any public purpose at all and to the still more absurd result that while Parliament will have to provide for compensation under article  () in a law made by it for acquisitio\u2022 of property for a public purpose it will not have to make any provision for compensation in a law made for acquisition of property to be made without a public purpose. if it sees fit to do so, but it is not likely that it will be found disregarding it, without plain expres1sions of such a purpose.\" This principle is embodied in article  () of our Constitution in these terms - \"~o prop_erty, iiovable or immovaJle, including any mterest m, or m any company ownmg, any com- mercial or industrial undertaking, shall be taken pos- session of or acquired for public purposes under any law authorising the taking of such possession or such acquisition, unless the law provides for compensation for the property taken possession of or acquired and either fixes the amount of the compensation, or specifies the principles on which, and the manner in which, the compensation JS to be determined and given.\" We shall not here trouble ourselves with sub-clauses () and () of the article and with articles -A and -B which were introduced by way of amendment under the Constitution First Amendment Act, , dated --."

It is this last condition which seems to have been relied upon by industrial \u2022 tribunals in holding that there must be direct ctmnec- tion hetween the efforts of labour and the profits, and unless that direct connection is established the profits must be treated as unrelated to the efforts of labour and thus become extraneous income. There is no doubt that there must be contribution of the workmen in earning profits before they are entitled to profit bonus but it wa.s not laid down in the Muir Mills Case(') that direct connection between the efforts of the workmen and the particular item of profit earned must be established before the profit can be taken into account for the purposes of arriving at the available ()  () S.C.R. . But apart from these cases, we cannot see how income arising during the year in the normal course of business of the concern can be called extraneous income merely on the ground that no direct connection between the efforts of labour and the accrual of the income has been established."

It may be noted here that the proceedings before the Industrial Tribunal had commenced without the necessary sanction of the High Court in the liquida- tion proceedings, but during the pendency of the proceedings, the High Court, by its order dated Decem- ber , , granted leave to the workmen to proceed with and continue the proceedings against the Official Liquidators of the Company. The Tribunal put this on three main grounds-() that the auction-purchaser had purchased the business of the Company free from all encumbrances, out-goings and liabilities, () that tho employment of the work- men had been terminated hy the Liquidators before possession of the business was delivered to the auction- purchaser, and () that there was no relationship of employer and employees between the auction-purchaser and the workmen whose services were so terminated."

Held, that the workmen were not entitled to puja bonus as an implied term of employment for an implied agreement could not be inferred when the appellant had made it clear that the payments from  to  were ex gratia but they were entitled to puja bonus on the basis that it was a customary and traditional payment. In determining whether the payment was customary and traditional the following circumstances have to be established (i) that the payment has been made over an unbroken series of years , (ii) that it has been for a sufficiently long period, the period has to be longer than in the case of an implied term of employment (iii) that it has been paid even in years of loss and did not depend on the earning of profits and (iv) that the payment has been made at a uniform rate throughout. The decision of the Appellate Tribunal has also mixed the two aspects of puja bonus, namely, whether it is based on an implied term of employment or on custom but it came to the conclusion that there was sufficient evidence to establish custom and therefore ordered payment of one month's basic wages as puja bonus. At that time it was said on behalf of the company before the industrial tribunal that some bonus was being paid and that there was no intention to discontinue it and conse- quently .the tribunal did not adjudicate upon the matter, which shows that the company recognised the traditional and customary nature of the payment and it assured the tribunal that there was no intention then to discontinue the payment."

A return which showed no assessable income, could not possibly be 'treated' as a return filed under section () or a return called for under that section but filed under section (), when in fact it was filed in response to a notice under section ().\" The opinion here expressed was criticised in the judgment under appeal, and in the next case, R.  \" 'It should be remembered', I observed 'that the return in the present case is being sought to be treated as a return under section (), belatedly filed.' And then I went on to say that a return under section () would only be filed by a person who thought that he had a taxable income and therefore a return showing an income below the taxable limit could not be held, on a construction thereof, to be a return under section () and consequently the return in the case we were then considering could not be treated as such a return filed under section (). To say that, was not to say that even a return filed in compliance with a notice under section (), if filed belatedly under section () could not be a return showing an income below the taxable limit.'' This left the matter somewhat ambiguous as to what was really meant, and in Commissioner of Income-f,ax v.

Indeed, the Sessions Judge went to the length of telling the jury that although an approver's evidence is strictly admissible and a conviction is not illegal merely because it is based on an approver's evidence, it was a settled rule of practice not to convict a person on such evidence except under very rare and excep- tional circumstances and usually substantial cor- roboratLm was required. Apart from the question of corrobora- tion of the approver's evidence nothing was suggested to us or to the High Court in what respect the approver's evidence was unreliable after testing his evidence in the same way as one would test the evid- ence of any witness for the prosecution in a criminal case. It would be in high degree dangerous to attempt to formulate the kind of evidence which would be regarded as corroboration, except to say that corroborative evidence is evidence which shows or tends to show that the story of the accomplice that the accused committed the crime is true, not merely that the crime has been committed, but that it was commit- ted by the accused. \" In the present case the jury had been clearly directed by the Sessions Judge that corroborative evidence must be evidence which implicates the accused, i.e., which confirms in some material particulars not only the evidence that the crime had been committed but also that the appellant had committed it."
